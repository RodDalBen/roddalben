### Hi there 👋

I turn complex health data into actionable insights that improve patient outcomes and advance therapies. 
With 10+ years of experience in quantitative research, I specialize in patient-centred outcomes research—understanding how diseases and treatments impact patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. My work bridges clinical research, health economics, and real-world evidence, translating data into strategic decisions that matter for therapy development and population health.

Core Expertise:
• Patient-Centred Research: Developed outcome measures assessing caregiver quality of life, economic burden of paediatric conditions, and patient-caregiver perception alignment
• Statistical & ML Modelling: Advanced proficiency in R, Python, and SQL for regression modelling, survival analysis, propensity score methods, and machine learning applications
• Real-World Data Analysis: Experience wrangling large datasets from diverse sources, building reproducible analytical pipelines, and creating effective visualisations for technical and non-technical audiences
• Regulatory & Scientific Rigour: Strong foundation in mixed methods research design, protocol development, statistical analysis planning, and peer-reviewed publication (18+ publications)

Technical Toolkit:
R | Python | SQL | Git/GitHub | Machine Learning | Statistical Inference | Data Visualisation | Reproducible Research Workflows

I'm passionate about integrating the patient voice into healthcare research. Whether conducting comparative effectiveness studies, developing clinical outcome assessments, or applying causal inference methods, I focus on generating evidence that supports better treatment decisions and market access strategies. Currently supporting patient-reported health economics research at University of Calgary's Cumming School of Medicine, where I manage data for multinational teams, develop sustainable data practices, and build scalable analytics solutions.
