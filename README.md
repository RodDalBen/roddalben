### Hi there 👋

I am a Psychology researcher broadly interested in learning and language, and open science practices. I am passionate about parsimonious explanations and inventive methods. I am constantly working with empirical research and data science (wrangling, visualization, analyses...the whole package). I really enjoy being part of large-scale collaborations such as the [ManyBabies](https://manybabies.github.io/) consortium. My [personal website](https://osf.io/ebvd5/) has up to date information about my research and teaching.

**Have a great day!**
